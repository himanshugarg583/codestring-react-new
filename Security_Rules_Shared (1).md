# Fonix — AI Security Rules (Shared)

**This file applies to EVERY developer. Paste this PLUS your role-specific file (Frontend or Backend) into your AI tool before writing any code.**

---

## S1. Secrets & Environment Variables

- **NEVER** hardcode any of the following in source code, config files, comments, or output:
  - Database connection strings (`DATABASE_URL`)
  - API keys: Stripe, Razorpay, Anthropic, Resend, Twilio, AWS, or any third-party service
  - JWT secrets (`JWT_SECRET`), webhook signing secrets
  - Any password, private key, access token, OAuth client secret, or `.pem` file
  - URLs with embedded credentials (e.g., `postgres://user:pass@host`)
- Always reference secrets via environment variables: `process.env.VAR` or `os.environ["VAR"]`
- When generating `.env` examples, use **placeholder values only** — never real-looking keys
- New env vars must be added to `.env.example` with a descriptive comment

```bash
# .env.example — safe to commit (placeholders only)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-minimum-32-characters
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_placeholder
RESEND_API_KEY=re_placeholder
```

---

## S2. Git Safety

**NEVER** generate code that commits these to git:
- `.env` files (any environment)
- `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `vendor/`
- Build artifacts: `.next/`, `dist/`, `build/`
- Database dumps or seed files with real data
- SSL certificates, private keys, `.pem` files
- IDE secrets (`.idea/`, `.vscode/settings.json` with tokens)

Always include a proper `.gitignore` when scaffolding projects. Always commit lock files (`package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`).

**Branch rules:**
- **NEVER** commit directly to `main` or `develop`. All work goes through feature branches.
- Branch format: `feature/FON-[ticket]-[description]`, `fix/FON-[ticket]-[description]`
- Commit format: `type(scope): description` — e.g., `feat(auth): add JWT refresh rotation`

---

## S3. Authentication Fundamentals

- Access tokens stored **in memory only** (React state / Zustand / variable). Refresh tokens in **HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies**.
- **NEVER** store tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` — vulnerable to XSS.
- **NEVER** place JWT secrets or any secret key in frontend code.
- Every API route must verify the JWT and check authorisation **before** any business logic.
- The `tenantId` and user role must come from the **verified JWT** — never from the request body.

---

## S4. Password Security

- **NEVER** store passwords in plain text. Use `bcrypt` (cost factor 10+) or `Argon2`.
- **NEVER** send passwords back in API responses — not even hashed.
- **NEVER** compare plain-text passwords. Always compare hashes.
- Implement account lockout or rate limiting after repeated failed login attempts.

---

## S5. Logging — What to NEVER Log

**NEVER** log any of the following:
- Passwords (plain-text or hashed)
- JWT tokens (access or refresh)
- Card numbers, CVV, or payment details
- Full request bodies containing PII
- API keys, AWS credentials, database connection strings
- Session tokens or cookies

**NEVER** use `console.log` in production code. Use the structured logger:
- **Node.js** → Pino
- **Python** → loguru

Log the **action**, relevant **IDs**, and **outcome** — not the sensitive payload.

---

## S6. Error Handling

- **NEVER** expose stack traces, file paths, database schemas, or library versions to the client in production.
- Return generic error messages with machine-readable error codes:

```json
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR", "message": "Something went wrong" } }
```

- **NEVER** swallow errors silently (empty `catch` blocks). Always log and handle.
- When a security check fails or throws, **deny access by default** — never fail open.

```
// ❌ WRONG — fails open
let isAuthorised = true;
try { isAuthorised = await checkPermission(user, resource); } catch { }

// ✅ Correct — fails closed
let isAuthorised = false;
try { isAuthorised = await checkPermission(user, resource); } catch (error) {
  logger.error({ error, userId: user.id }, "Permission check failed");
}
```

---

## S7. Payment Security

- Card numbers, CVV, and expiry dates must **NEVER** pass through the server.
- Always use **Razorpay Checkout** or **Stripe Elements** — hosted UI only.
- The webhook is the authoritative payment confirmation — not the client-side callback.
- Always verify webhook signatures before processing.
- Use idempotency keys to prevent duplicate charges.
- All payment amounts must be validated **server-side**. Never trust the price from the client.

---

## S8. Environment Separation

- **NEVER** use live Stripe/Razorpay keys in development or staging.
- **NEVER** import real production data without anonymising it.
- Dev/staging must **NEVER** send real emails, push notifications, or SMS to real users.
- Always include a dev/staging suppression guard in notification code.

---

## S9. Dependency & Supply Chain Security

- Always commit lock files (`package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`) to git.
- **NEVER** use `*` or broad version ranges in `package.json` or `requirements.txt`.
- Run `npm audit` / `pip audit` regularly. Fix critical and high vulnerabilities before merging.
- **NEVER** install packages from untrusted sources. Verify names carefully — typosquatting is real.
- Review `postinstall` scripts of new dependencies before adding them.

---

## S10. GDPR & Data Privacy

- Any data that identifies an EU/UK user is personal data: name, email, IP, device ID, phone.
- Code must support **right to erasure** — delete or anonymise all personal data for a user.
- **Data minimisation** — only store what is needed. Never store PII in logs or analytics.
- Cookie consent must be implemented before setting non-essential cookies.

---

## S11. AI-Specific Security

- **NEVER** pass raw user input directly into AI/LLM prompts without sanitisation.
- Separate system instructions from user content using proper message roles.
- **NEVER** trust AI-generated output as safe — validate before inserting into DB, rendering in HTML, or executing.
- AI API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI) follow the same secret rules. Proxy all AI calls through your backend — **NEVER** expose AI keys to frontend.

---

## S12. Code Quality (Security-Adjacent)

- **NEVER** use `var` in JS/TS. Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed.
- **NEVER** use `any` in TypeScript. Use `unknown` and narrow with type guards.
- **NEVER** use `@ts-ignore`. Fix the type error.
- Always use `===` (strict equality), never `==`.
- Always use optional chaining (`?.`) on nullable values.
- Always handle async errors with `try/catch`.
- **NEVER** leave `console.log`, uncommented `TODO` without ticket numbers, or commented-out code.
